   <p> A bicycle is a fun and healthy way to move around.<br> 
    It has two wheels, one behind the other, with a seat<br> and handlebars
     to steer. You pedal with your feet to<br> make it go. Bicycles come in
      different sizes and colors.<br> Some have baskets to carry things, others have bells to ring.</p>
      <p>A bicycle, also called a pedal cycle, bike, push-bike or cycle,<br> is a human-powered or motor-assisted, pedal-driven, single<br>-track vehicle, with two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other.</p>
